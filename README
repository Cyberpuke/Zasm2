Zasm
z80 assembler

Released under the GPL.

This project is now using git instead of cvs. The sourceforge repository
still exists for cvs, but it will be out of date as of June 25, 2009.

To try out the cvs:

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/zasm2 -z3 co zasm
 cd zasm
 ./configure
 make

patches and comments are always welcome. I dont know much about
assembler design, so i'm sure it's pretty ugly.
