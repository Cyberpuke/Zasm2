ZASM z80 Assembler
by James Lee Rubingh
------------------

This is a mini-assembler for unix, designed specifically
for the ti-series calculator and it's respective games.

It's a single pass assembler in the sense that it never
writes anything to disk until assembly is comlete. A
representation of the code is made in RAM with holes
for forward references, then when all labels have been
found it attempts to go back and patch up holes. Therefore
big files will use more ram.
